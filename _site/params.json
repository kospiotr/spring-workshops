{"name":"Spring-workshops","tagline":"Spring workshops","body":"Spring Workshops based on https://github.com/jakubnabrdalik/spring-workshops\r\n\r\n# Prerequisites\r\n* JDK 8\r\n* Maven\r\n* GIT\r\n* IDE\r\n\r\n#Application\r\n## Model\r\nLoans scoring system. \r\nYou give it a Loan Application (application - somebody applies for a loan). It fires up Fraud Detection System, verifies if it is a fraud or not. If not, it fires up scoring rules (many), sums up scores. Returns score.\r\nAll scoring rules, have configurable max score. There are two Fraud Detectors implementations, one for Poland, one for UK. There should be two scoring systems (UK, Poland), but they work the same, except for Fraud Detector.\r\n\r\n## Class structure\r\n* ScoreCalculator (main class)\r\n* FraudDetector\r\n * PolishFraudDetector\r\n * EnglishFraudDetector\r\n* Scoring Rule\r\n * AgeScoringRule\r\n * LoansHistoryScoringRule\r\n * JobScoringRule\r\n\r\n# Spring Core\r\n## XML configuration source\r\n\r\n+ Register ScoreCalculator with constructor injection\r\n+ Register ScoreCalculator with setter injection\r\n+ Register ScoreCalculator with a factory method\r\n+ Register Scoring Rules with a parent (bean definition inheritance)\r\n+ Register two ScoreCalculators, one for PL, one for UK\r\n\r\n## Annotations\r\n\r\n+ Remove xml\r\n+ Register ScoreCalculator with @Component\r\n+ Inject other bean with @Autowired\r\n+ Inject FraudDetector while having two beans implementing an interface (@Qualifier)\r\n+ @Autowire a constructor\r\n+ Try to register two ScoreCalculators, one for PL, one for UK\r\n\r\n## Java Config\r\n+ Remove all annotations\r\n+ Create a @Configuration class and register two ScoreCalculators, one for PL, one for UK via @Bean\r\n+ How many times AgeScoringRule are created?\r\n+ Remove @Configuration, add @Bean to @Component. How many times AgeScoringRule are created?\r\n\r\n## Scopes\r\n+ Make a new Rule: remembering last score for a given user. Add %10 points of last score to new score. \r\n+ Add this rule to ScoringRules. Register it once, and verify what object hash for this rule, both scoring calculators (PL and UK) have. \r\n+ Make it so that each Scoring Caclulator has a different instance of this bean, using prototype scope.\r\n+ Check if object hashes differ between this rule for PL and UK\r\n\r\n## Profiles\r\n+ Create LoansHistoryScoringRuleStub, that always gives 100 points.\r\n+ Register LoansHistoryScoringRuleStub so that it works only in tests.\r\n+ Register LoansHistoryScoringRule so that it works only in production and development.\r\n\r\n## Properties\r\n+ Move database login and password to properties file\r\n+ Move security login and password to properties file\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n+ Remove SecurityWebAppInitializer and HttpBasicSecurityConfig, change LoggedUserRepository to work as a Session scoped bean, fix tests\r\n\r\n# Spring MVC\r\n\r\nRequirements we're going to work on:\r\n+ We need an application for giving loans.\r\n+ We give loans for a week, two weeks, three weeks, or for a month.\r\n+ A logged user can see his loans, see his extensions, and what he owns.\r\n+ A logged user can apply for a loan by entering the amount and choosing term.\r\n+ A logged user can extend his loan for 1 week.\r\n+ The interest for a loan is 1% per day. But when extending, the interest goes up by 10%.\r\n+ User cannot have more than 3 active loans. The number of extensions is unlimited.\r\n+ We need an HTTP API for another system, to inform us, when a loan is paid up.\r\n+ When we have an error, user should be redirected to “we are sorry” page.\r\n\r\n# Spring AOP   \r\n+ The front page is often accessed. Create an aspect, which will cache list of loans for a user, without hitting a repository.\r\n\r\n# Spring Data JPA\r\n+ Change our loan application so that it works on the database\r\n\r\n# Spring Boot\r\nCreate a library application from the scratch (no copy&paste) with Spring Boot\r\nRequirements:\r\n+ JSON API\r\n+ As a user, I can add a book\r\n+ As a user, I can find available books by author or title\r\n+ As a user, I can borrow the book\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
